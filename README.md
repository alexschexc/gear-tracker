## Project Status: Pre-Alpha

This project is currently in a Pre-Alpha state. It is quickly moving towards a Minimal Viable Product. The intent is for this software to run offline forever. This is partly because I don't want to be responsible for people's data, partly to respect your privacy as an end user, and partly because that's not what I'm experimenting with in this project.

## Run time instructions for testing the current source code

to run these files as they sit you first need to install the PyQt6 library to your environment:

```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

then run it like this:

```bash
python ui.py
```

Once MVP is achieved we'll have a published single file Binary. Currently I am only supporting Linux. Windows and MacOS support might come in the future based on feedback and demand.
