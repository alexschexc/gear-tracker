## Project Status: Pre-Alpha

This project is currently in a Pre-Alpha state. It is quickly moving towards a Minimal Viable Product. The intent is for this software to run offline forever. This is partly because I don't want to be responsible for people's data, partly to respect your privacy as an end user, and partly because that's not what I'm experimenting with in this project.

## Security & Privacy

- This app stores all data locally in a single SQLite file. The developer does not operate any server and never has access to your data.

- You are responsible for securing and backing up your own data (e.g., encrypted drives, offline backups).

- This tool is for personal record‑keeping only and does not constitute legal or compliance advice.

## Run time instructions for testing the current source code

to run these files as they sit you first need to install the PyQt6 library to your environment:

```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

then run it like this:

```bash
python ui.py
```

Once MVP is achieved we'll have a published single file Binary. Currently I am only supporting Linux. Windows and MacOS support are coming in the immediate future.
