## Run time instructions for testing the current source code
to run these files as they sit you first need to install the PyQt6 library to your environment:
```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

then run it like this:
```bash
python ui.py
```

Once MVP is achieved we'll have a published single file Binary. Currently I am only supporting Linux. Windows and MacOS support might come in the future based on feedback and demand.
